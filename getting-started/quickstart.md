### Creating a market

GitBook supports importing content from many popular writing tools and formats. If your content already exists, you can upload a file or group of files to be imported.

### Swapping

GitBook also allows you to set up a bi-directional sync with an existing repository on GitHub or GitLab. Setting up Git Sync allows you and your team to write content in GitBook or in code, and never have to worry about your content becoming out of sync.
